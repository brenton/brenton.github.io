I read this book in 2019 and it has surprisingly helped me understand the
transportation crises we've seen as a result of Covid.  Why did it take two
months for my baby's bicycle seat to arrive from Europe?  Surprise!
International US Postal Service shipments from Europe rely 100% on *passenger
airlines*.  Why are crops rotting in the fields?  Are people eating less?  No!
The supply chain for restaurants and grocery stores in the US are completely
separate.  Some farms only serve the restaurant industry and it's taking time
for these former competitors to work together keep the US fed.

This book surprised me on several levels.  First, the style is fascinating and
really makes me stop and think about the vast behind the scenes transportaion
network we rely on.  Secondly, it unified many of the topics I care about in
ways I had not considered: Social Justice, Traffic Violence, Environmental
concerns.

Now, I should mention that this book represents a departure from my normal
reading habits in that I found this book by strolling down the library on a
date night.  Nearly without exception I will only read a book as a result of a
recommendation from a friend.  I rate this book a {{ page.rating }} primarily
because I don't think the entire book will be interesting to a wide audience.
If you're a person that is OK with reading part of a book (I am not) you'll
likely find a good portion of it enlightening.  If that's you, at another point
to my rating.

Miscellaneous things I remember roughly a year later:
* Domino's Pizza is a logistics company.  Pizza is their side hustle.
* Cival War soldiers in the US drank better coffee than my grandparents.
* The majority of everything we get from Asia comes through Los Angeles.  It's
  so critical that Congress gets involved when things slow down.  It also
  happens to be the biggest port in the world by a few metrics.
* Some 90+% of all components the US military originate from Asia.
* The vast majority of container ships in the world are owned by Danish
  companies.  They ship nearly everything the entire world uses.  Practically
  nothing related to this critical industry is in US control (eg, You can't buy
  MUSA shipping container cranes, nor ships, etc)
* The containers we ship our stuff in are far better engineered for safety than
  the containers we ship ourselves in (cars).  The chapter on our road network
  made me cry.  I wasn't prepared for the manner in which the author was going
  to tackle this subject.  My wife decided to put the book down because it was
  too intense at that point.
