"Why would they smash all the windows downtown?", my daughter asked in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder.  I don't remember the answer I gave at the time.  I'm sure it wasn't very good.

The truth is, I barely understand how we got here, much less what we can do about it.  _{{ page.title }}_ was exactly the book I needed to wake up from my ignorance.  After waiting nearly three months for my copy to arrive at the local library, I was excited begin my own epic journey through it's pages.

My excitement quickly turned to reverence.  Three pages into {{ page.author }}'s book I had to stop.  I simply could not read any more.  Not until I found my kids and told them that I wanted to read this book to them aloud.  Actually, I said I  _needed_ to read this book to them.  The subject simply could not wait. "This book will help us understand why the windows are smashed downtown."

We were not prepared for was was about to happen in our home over the following weeks—and five hundred pages.  The lives of three Black people would become _real_ to us.  Their thoughts and dreams, so alike our own, would draw us in night after night.

On some evenings I couldn't hold back tears.  So much cruelty.  So much murder.  So many Blacks for whom there would be no books written about.  Dormant images I saw of lynchings years before in an exhibit at [The Museum of the New South](https://www.museumofthenewsouth.org/exhibits) once again took on flesh.  I stopped.  "Did you hear what just happened?  A twelve year old boy was tortured in front of his father and thrown in a lake where he died.  No one was punished."  His crime?  He gave a letter to a white girl.  My oldest son is twelve and my daughter, a white girl.  For a brief moment, we were part of the story.

There would be many more connections.  One night—after and hour and a half of reading aloud to my kids—I took a quick glance at the local news.  I was drawn to an article about [a nearby historical train roundhouse](https://www.wral.com/raleighs-lost-train-roundhouse-century-old-footprint-from-steam-era-hidden-in-downtown/19199462/).  "Seaboard Air Line Railway?  Where have I heard that before?"  A state of disbelief took hold.  "That's the rail line where Lil George worked!", I shouted to my kids and my wife—who was trying to begin her evening ritual of relaxation.  "He worked on the Seaboard Air Line Railway traveling up and down the east coast.  Do you know what this means?  Lil George used to come through Raleigh!"

I can't believe I had never made that connection.  My wife and I love date night's at any [Seaboard Station](https://seaboardstationshops.com/) restuarant, but I never thought about where the name _Seaboard_ came from.  Lil George had loaded tons of luggage in a building that now serves as our favorite [garden shop](https://www.logantrd.com/our-history-vision).  My luxury was his burden.  I can't believe I had never made _that_ connection.

"We grow collards in our backyard just like them", 

As we came to the end of the book an overwhelming sense of sorrow weighed on me much like the hundred pound sack of cotton Ida Mae's husband would carry in the fields.  I was alive during the last years of all three of the main character's.  I knew how the story was going to end and it's more clear than ever that we haven't solved our problems yet.   

We grow collards in our yard.

comes from the fact that I've spent so much of my life in the South.  

For me some of the emotion ... I feel like I know Ida Mae, George and Pershing more than my own parents.
