"Why would they smash all the windows downtown?", my daughter asked in the aftermatch of George Floyd's murder.  I don't remember the answer I gave at the time.  I'm sure it wasn't very good.

Weeks later my request for {{ page.title }} came in at the libary.  Having spent the last few months in quarantine reading every decent kindle book the library owned I was excited to once again have a book I could hold in my hands.

Three pages into {{ page.author }}'s book I had to stop.  I simply could not read any more.  Not until I found my kids and told them that I wanted to read this book to them aloud.  I actually said I _needed_ to read this book to them.  I reserve a {{ page.rating }} out of 10 for books that I require my children to read some day.  This book simply could not wait.  "This book will help us understand why are the windows were smashed downtown."

We were not prepared for was was about to happen in our home over the following three weeks (and five hundred pages).  The lives of three Black people would become _real_ to us.  Their thoughts, their dreams, so alike our own drew us in night after night.

I'm not sure my kids have seen me cry so much.  At first it was caused by the murder of Blacks for whom there would be no books written about.  Dormant images I saw of lynchings years before in an exhibit at [The Museum of the New South](https://www.museumofthenewsouth.org/exhibits) once again took on flesh.  I stopped.  "Did you hear what just happened?  A twelve year old boy was tortured in front of his father and thrown in a lake where he died.  No one was punished."  His crime?  He gave a letter to a white girl.  My oldest son is twelve and my daughter is a white girl.  For a brief moment, we were part of the story.

For us there would be many more connections.  One night after and hour and a half of reading aloud to my kids I took a quick glance at the local news.  I was drawn to an article about [a nearby historical train roundhouse](https://www.wral.com/raleighs-lost-train-roundhouse-century-old-footprint-from-steam-era-hidden-in-downtown/19199462/).  "Seaboard Air Line Railway?  Where have I heard that before?"  A state of disbelief took hold.  "That's the rail line where Lil George worked!", I shouted to my kids and my wifeâ€”who was trying to begin her evening ritual of relaxation.  "He worked on the Seaboard Air Line Railway traveling up and down the east coast.  Do you know what this means?  Lil George used to come through Raleigh!"

I can't believe I had never made the connection.  A night alone with my wife at any [Seaboard Station](https://seaboardstationshops.com/) restuarant .  He had loaded thousands of people's luggage at the station that now serves as our favorite [garden shop](https://www.logantrd.com/our-history-vision).  My luxury is Lil George's burden.  I can't believe I had never made the connection.

"We grow collards in our backyard just like them", 

As we came to the end of the book an overwhelming sense of sorrow weighed on me much like the hundred pound sack of cotton Ida Mae's husband would carry in the fields.  I was alive during the last years of all three of the main character's.  I knew how the story was going to end and it's more clear than ever that we haven't solved our problems yet.   

We grow collards in our yard.

comes from the fact that I've spent so much of my life in the South.  

For me some of the emotion ... I feel like I know Ida Mae, George and Pershing more than my own parents.

stopped and told my kids to sit nearby and I that was going to read to them a book that mattered.  I wasn't prepared for what was to follow.  Over the next five hundred pages
