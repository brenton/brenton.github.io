I've read a lot of books about cycling and, just like an upright bike with fat tires, this is probably the best allrounder.  Why only a {{ page.rating }}?  Well, to be honest I wouldn't suggest reading most of the other books about bicycles I've read.  That may be the highest you'll ever see from me.  So again, if you were to read only one book about riding a bike this is it.  It's short, funny and will hopefully undo much of the damage we've suffered at the hands of racing industry.

Even if you've been riding for decades, you will learn something from this book.  I'm disappointed it took me ten of thousands of miles to realize the joy of having a front basket on my bike.  Swaping all my drop bars for more upright "north road" style handlebars was also a result of reading this book.  I've always been a "plain clothes" rider, but this book also sold me on the safety benefits of slow urban riding without a helmet and affixing a large safety triangle somewhere to myself or bike.  Perhaps most importantly, it's helped me to understand more clearly the joys of riding a bike and how to avoid the stuff I now realize I really don't like at all.
