I read this book in early 2019, probably the same month I read [Door to
Door]({% link _books/door-to-door.markdown %}).  In my mind these two books are
likely more related than most people would think.

Things I still remember over a year later:
* We get angry when we drive because of the way it dehumanizes us.  Our
  powerful systems for human interaction devolve into honking a horn.  We want
to tell that person in front of us about the stupid thing they just did, but we
can't.  Normally we'd be able to talk through something like this but, denied
this opportunity, we resort to rage.
* There is no other activity we commonly engage in wherein the same person who
  would happily open the door for us as we enter a store will actively
attempt to murder us later that day while on public properly.
* Designing roads is really hard.  Irrational human behavior confounds engineer
  expectations.  For example, it has proven impossible to convince motorists to
drive efficiently.
* Many will then say, "and that's why we need self-driving cars!"
  Unfortunately, the crushing weight of evidence provided in this book has led
me to believe we will never see improvements in safety from a company whose
primary goal is to make money selling cars to users.  The things that make
driving fun make it deadly.  This applies especially to self-driving cars.
Thankfully, there are some companies in the mix who have other means of
monitizing self-driving cars.  Their products are not going to result in the
futuristic, high-speed, extreme density many people invision.  The future of
self-driving cars, if it is safer that humans driving, will be slow.  Very slow.
* Engineering has failed us (and some of engineers actually know this).  Take
  two roads with the same 25 mph speed limit.  A neighborhood road with a
beautiful tree canopy and a North Carolina highway bisecting a rural town (I'm
pretty sure the example in the book actually uses my home state).  In the case
of the neighborhood we will naturally slow down becuase the design informs us
to do so.  In the case of the highway, it's excruciating.  Moment prio you were
flying down the road at an excess of 55 mph and now nothing has changed except
for a sign.  If you have driven much you probably know this feeling.  It
literally feels like you are crawling down the road in agony.  This is a well
understood mental situation and design can solve this.  It's the reason why the
distance between lane divider marks on highways will occationaly vary according
to the speed limit.  We've grown accustomed to a particular rhythm of little
white lines zooming by our size and will adjust our speed to accordingly.  In
the same way, highways lined with towering blank concrete walls will make us
speed up whereas a more detailed facade will drawn attention to our speed and
cause us to slow down.
* As with [Door to Door]({% link _books/door-to-door.markdown %}), Los Angeles
  is a surprising place.  I would never imagined the technical infrastructure
required just to allow actors to arrive by car to the Oscars.
