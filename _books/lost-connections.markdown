It's afternoon on a slow Sunday and I'm thinking about {{ page.author }}'s _{{ page.title }}_.  Lately I've had an unusual amount of time to reflect on my last year's worth of reading.  Seven days ago around this time I was limping home in my wife's arms after spraining my ankle playing soccer with my kids.

Turns out I broke my 5th metatarsal.  That small little bump on the bottom right side of my right foot connects several important tendons and ligaments that provide stability.  My two-hundred and five other bones are doing just fine, but this small one took me down.

In the same way, {{ page.author }} shows the latest research on how surprisingly simple problems can cause undue suffering.  Just as it's natural to feel pain in my foot for the next several weeks (or months), it's just as reasonable to experience grief consistent with the degree of trauma.  Sadly, the pharmaceutical industry has [seventeen-billion reasons](https://time.com/4900248/antidepressants-depression-more-common/) to deny us a natural response to broken world.  How long has it been since your child died?  Two months?  You must be depressed and depression is bad.  Take this pill.  When it stops doing the trick, just double the dosage.

Anytime a remedy only works for a short period of time before requiring increasing dosages, we should at least wonder if the Placebo Effect is actually doing the working.  I found this so interesting that, after reading _{{ page.title }}_, I checked out everything I could on the Placebo Effect at my local library.  I'll have to write about those books next but for now I'll leave you with a teaser from [Dan Ariely](https://today.duke.edu/2008/03/placeboprice.html).  "The placebo effect is one of the most fascinating, least harnessed forces in the universe."

Like Hari, I wish these pills mostly worked in the long run.  It would make things so much simpler.  If someone could convince me a pill would speed up my recovery right now I'd probably take it tooâ€”and maybe skimp on the months of physical therapy.   

The evidence shows that our depression and anxiety are largely problems of our environment.  Just as it's reasonable to treat my foot's swelling if it prevents me from making progress with therapy, Hari would agree there is a small place for pills.

The real value of the work lies in Parts Two and Three.  


A seemingly minor disconnection for a part I never before appreciated.
