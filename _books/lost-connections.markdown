It's afternoon on a slow Sunday and I'm thinking about {{ page.author }}'s _{{ page.title }}_.  I've had an unusual amount of time to reflect on my last year of reading.  Seven days ago around this time I was limping home in my wife's arms after spraining my ankle playing soccer with my kids.

Turns out I broke my 5th metatarsal.  That small little bump on the bottom right side of my right foot connects several important tendons and ligaments that provide stability.  My two-hundred and five other bones are doing just fine, but this small one took me down.

In the same way, {{ page.author }} presents the latest research on simple causes behind the crippling duo of anxiety and depression.  The pain in my foot is logical given my injury.  It's no less reasonable to experience grief consistent with the degree of trauma.  Unfortunately, the pharmaceutical industry has [seventeen-billion reasons](https://time.com/4900248/antidepressants-depression-more-common/) to deny us a natural response to broken world.  How long has it been since your child died?  Two months?  You must be depressed and depression is bad.  Take this pill.  When it stops doing the trick, you'll need to double the dosage.

Anytime a remedy works for a short period of time before requiring increasing dosages, we should at least wonder if the Placebo Effect is actually doing the working.  I found this so interesting that, after reading _{{ page.title }}_, I read several more books the subject at my local library.  I've come to agree with [Dan Ariely](https://today.duke.edu/2008/03/placeboprice.html), author of _Predictably Irrational_.  "The placebo effect is one of the most fascinating, least harnessed forces in the universe."

Like Hari, I wish these pills mostly worked in the long run.  It would make things so much simpler.  If someone could convince me a pill would fix my foot I'd probably take it right nowâ€”and maybe skimp on the months of physical therapy.  But what if, lacking the perfect pill, I settled for solving the pain _problem_ instead.  Pain is bad afterall.  To celebrate my victory, perhaps I would go for a walk.

My swollen foot is trying to tell me something if I'm willing to listen. It's saying leave me alone.  Treating symptoms isn't going to solve this problem.  But that's exactly where pharmaceutical companies stop with anxiety and depression.  Just give me the pill.  Nevermind it's 2020 and I haven't hugged a friend in eight months.  I am getting good at expressing my deepest emotions with emojis though.
