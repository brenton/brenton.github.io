It's afternoon on a slow Sunday and I'm thinking about {{ page.author }}'s _{{ page.title }}_.  Lately I've had an unusual amount of time to reflect on my last year's worth of reading.  Seven days ago around this time I was limping home in my wife's arms after spraining my ankle playing soccer with my kids.

Turns out I broke my 5th metatarsal.  That small little bump on the bottom right side of my right foot connects several important tendons and ligaments that provide stability.  My two-hundred and five other bones are doing just fine, but this one took me down.

In the same way, {{ page.author }} shows the latest research on how surprisingly simple problems can cause undue suffering.  But, just as it's natural to feel pain in my foot for the next several weeks (or months), it's just as reasonable to experience grief consistent with the degree of trauma.  Sadly, the pharmaceutical industry has [seventeen-billion reasons](https://time.com/4900248/antidepressants-depression-more-common/) to deny us a natural response to broken world.  Instead they will happily treat the symptoms for the remainder


A seemingly minor disconnection for a part I never before appreciated.
