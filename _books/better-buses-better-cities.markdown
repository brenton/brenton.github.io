If you know me, you probably know that I enjoy riding my bike.  So much so
that, for a number of years, I probably would have tried to convince you to
scrap your automobile, buy a steel bike and join me to SAVE THE WORLD.  As
years went on, I won over a few converts, but I started to doubt that bicycles
are really the best approach to improving cities for all at this point in US
history.

Enter the humble bus.  It's accessible to all abilities, more nimble, uses
current infrastructure and can move orders of magnitude more people than
personal automobiles.  The problem?  Well, for starters, there's the stigma of
poverty associated with them in significant parts of US culture.  Then there's
the fact that, while many cities are starting to improve their bus systems,
they tragically undo most of the benefits by investing all the more in
improvements for single occupancy motor vehicles.  But that's not all.
Politicians know that they need to appeal to the broadest voting population.
How can they avoid alienating their vast car-loving populous and yet still
manage to win the hearts of uninformed environmentalists?  Easy!  Just focus
all the attention on futuristic technology that will never see the light of
day, but sounds like something George Jetson would covet.

{{ page.author}} has what many now consider to be the best solutions to these
problems and more.  I'll just come out and say a few of them:

* Focus attention on the lines that serve the most people, even if that means
  stopped some lines.  Service levels must be 15 minutes or less.
* Empower transit agencies to do, you know... simply things.  Like
  determine where bus shelters can be placed.  Most people don't realize this
is managed by a completely different part of the government and often they have
[zero interest](https://twitter.com/brentonson/status/1143866357932580869) in serving transit needs.  
* Focus on walkability and connecting to other modes of transportation.

While this clearly yet another US-centric transit book, I think it has
relevance for much of the developing (transit) world.  My family and I spent a
month in Cuenca, Ecuador in 2019 and I think it opened the eyes of my children
how liberating equitable transit can be.  Instead of the coddled lives
non-driving kids face in the US, kids their age can safely travel throughout a
city just as big as the one we live back home, without having to beg a parent
to take them some place.  Who cares if the buses are old, noisy and fairly
uncomfortable?  They're faster than driving and cheaper.  I can only hope Latin
America continues to do the right things and doesn't fall into the trap of
wasting money to add USB ports and free wifi to their fleet.
