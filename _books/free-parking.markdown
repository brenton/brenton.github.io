*Me*: "I just read a fantastic book!"
 
*Friend*: "Tell me more!  I do love fantastic books. What's it about?"

*Me*: "It's all about PARKING!"

*Friend*: "Oh... (did he *really* just say 'parking'?) That, uh... sounds
nice.  (looking at watch)  Whoah, what do you know. Look at the time! I need to go... do that
thing... I was... going... to do... later... today.  Bye!"

After have one variation of that conversation or another with many of friends
and family I eventually came to realize that most people will never want to
read an 800+ page book on parking.  That's why I only rated the book a {{ page.rating
}}.  Honestly, if you are a city planner, this is the *only* research book on
parking that has ever been published.  For you, this book is a 10.  For
everyone else, just watch [this <7 minute
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Akm7ik-H_7U) from the author.  It covers
the highlevel concepts that explain how poorly managed parking has devasting
consequences for our lives.

If that sounds unbelieveable.  Consider the following:

* We will never have affordable housing in any thriving US city until parking
  policies are improved.  Never.  Stop wasting time listening to politicians
wax poetic about how they are going to solve our housing crisis if they can't
explain how it relates to parking.
* Still not convinced?  What percentrage of your city is devoted to parking?  Do
  you have any idea?  Of course you don't (but don't feel too bad).  It's
actually extremely difficult to calculate because the definition of what
consitutes a parking space can be vague at times.  For example, it's easier to count the
spaces at your nearby big box store than it is to estimate how much of our
public roads are dedicated to street parking.  Plus there's a lot of private
parking available too in the form of parking decks, driveways and garages.  Suffice
it to say that the number one land use in your city is to store sleeping cars.
In most cities there will be between 8 and 16 parking spaces reserved for your
personal automobile.  That space is likely larger than the lot your house
resides on.
* Ok, so that's odd, but it gets worse.  Cities require developers to include
  parking when they want to build things.  Why are there no affordable places
to live near vibrant downtowns?  Is it simply because the land is so expensive?
Surprisingly, the answer is "no".  Shoup's book shows how somewhere around 30%
of the cost of housing is actually a result of the required minimum parking the
developer must provide.  When land is scarce builders have no where to go but
up.  Unfortunately the parking requirements go up as well which usually entails
an wildly expensive parking deck (if for some reason the deck must be underground,
substitute the word "wildly" with "astronomical").  The people living in the
building must pay for it even if they don't own a car.
* If there's one thing that competes with parking in suburban and urban areas
  of the US, it's the space dedicated to public roads.  If you know my reading
habits, you also know I love reading books that include clever studies.
However, I don't like hearing about them when they report how between 40% and
60% of the cars driving around urban areas are merely looking for free (or the
most underpriced) parking.  Especially when my city spends hundreds of millions
of dollars widening and maintaining these same streets, at the expense of my
wallet, but more importantly my safety.

The good news is that, just like that short video, the end of the book explains
proven solutions to all these problems.  Even better, the book shows how they
can be implemented in a way that benefits everyone.  It sounds too good to be
true, but cities are starting to take notice and improvements are happening
slowly.
