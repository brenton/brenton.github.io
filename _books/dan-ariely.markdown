No Small Feet

I don't like going to the doctor.  But I'll do anything to show my wife how much I love her. Fifteen years ago that day we said the words, "in sickness and in health"—and I, for one, meant it.  What more romantic way to put flesh on those worn words than to break my foot.

"Look what I got you babe, radiographs of my metatarsals!  I knew you like a man with a big foot", I boasted—puffing my chest as much as I could while grasping my crutches.

"Oh honey, you shouldn't have!", my wife exclaimed. "Been playing soccer at your age", she continued.

Breaking my foot has been full of surprises. Yesterday my kids mowed the grass.  Today, while I was icing my injury, I heard a duet played by my wife on the weed trimmer and my firstborn on the blower.  It sounded a bit like John Cage's *Imaginary Landscape*, but much more delightful, since it was my actual landscape. 

These surprises have come with their dosage of stress.  Namely, I'm worried about the bills that will soon arrive.  X-rays and orthopedic devices aren't the half of it.  Do you know the going rate for live-in post-operative care?  My kids do.  Every time I ring this bell for an icepack it's thirty bucks.  Oh, you want it cold? Make that fifty.

Well played, kids.  Give your armchair economist dad a taste of his espoused market norms.   Who am I, a mere *homo economicus*, to judge the invisible hand that has turned against me?

But oh how quickly the economist forgets that even they have two hands!  Our world may be heavily skewed towards our egoistic rational right hand, but the oft shunned irrational left, likewise, holds society together.  Known more broadly as behavioral economics, this hand is the bond that leads us to rescue a stranded friend for a high five instead of a fiver.

So that's it.  I'll buy a Dan Ariely box set for each of my kids—that's way cheaper than icepacks.  I just know they'll love it.  After all, I rated these books a {{ page.rating }} (congratulations Dan—that's no small feat).
