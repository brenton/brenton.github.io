These books each deserve their own review and I may write them eventually.  I
read them all around the same time earlier this year and, given they follow a
theme, it seems reasonable to mention them together here.  Reflecting now
on how these books have benefitted me, here's the elevator pitch:

* *So Good* will explain a rational approach to finding lifelong joy in your
  work.
* *Deep Work* is the super power you need to do so.
* *Digital Minimalism* is a continuation that bring insight not only for work, but general life.

Deep Work is probably the most popular, but read So Good first.
