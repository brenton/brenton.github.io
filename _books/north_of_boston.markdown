The fence

The fastest way to Bryant's house  
Is to run towards the barn,  
And take a right at the manure pile.

When you see the old farmer's workshop run fast  
Through the sandy soil and around the corner.

Take care crossing his narrow wooden bridge.  
It's a swamp down thereâ€”  
A mix of milkweed, mosquitoes, and motor oil.

Of course,  
I fell in one time.  
Even better,  
Kelly saw the whole thing.

That reminds me, I forgot a step.  
More of a jump really.  
For the old farmer later strung barbed wire,  
Which begs a boy to jump it.

It never once occurred to me,  
That he wanted to keep me out.
