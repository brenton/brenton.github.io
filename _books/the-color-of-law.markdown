This marks one of a handful of books that will be required reading for my
children should they wish to graduate from homeschool.  The message is so
important you should not wait to read the book but instead watch [Segregated By
Design](https://www.segregatedbydesign.com/), a short 17 minute film by the
author.  This film covers every topic from the book at a highlevel.  The book
dives deeper into the history and includes no stortage of peer reviewed
studies.

While I expected the book to detail the problems of major American cities with
history roots steeped in racism, I found it particularly surprising to see my
own county referenced as a modern day example of a devastatingly segregated
education system.  Then there was the housing market problems in 2008 that I
lived through.  At the time I would not have been able to understand how
minorities suffered disproportionately in the face of American greed.

At one point I put the book down, navigated to my local governments online
Registrar of Deeds just to [see for
myself](https://twitter.com/brentonson/status/1095484786762756096/photo/1) the
sort of racism that divided my city.  Moments later I found a 1917 deed for the
sell of a home downtown Raleigh wherein the "Restrictive Covenent" excluded
anyone that is not white.

I will admit I can get furious about this topic, especially when I see it
playing out right before my eyes.  If this is hard for you to discuss with
others, consider sharing a more lighthearted video by [Adam
Conover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETR9qrVS17g) covering the same topic.
