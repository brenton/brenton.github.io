I suspect I'll eventually write a number of posts on the subject of learning foreign languages.  For now, if you desire to learn one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, this is one of the few books you need.  Surprisingly, given that I just hinted at this book helping you speak Mandarin Chinese, it is completely divorced from spoken language!  The premise of this book is that there are extraordinary benefits from starting your language journey by learning the "hardest part" first.

What do I mean by this?  Well, normally if you are learning Chinese you'll start by focusing on some simple phrases and vocabulary.  To keep you from getting discouraged, your teacher will mostly likely represent the sounds in one of the most popular romanizations, Pinyin.  However, knowing the onerous task before you, your teacher will soon begin introducing you to Chinese characters little by little.  First week maybe a handful: 一, 二, 三.  That's not so bad and in the second week you'll get a few more.   After a few short *years* you graduate to phrases like 魑魅魍魉 and will almost be able to read a newspaper!  No, not a newspaper in Traditional Chinese, but at least one in Simplified (used by most of mainland China).  Of course, if you slack off while slogging on this journey your hard won characters will exit your brain faster than a bullet train out of Beijing.

As you can imagine, that is a bit soul crushing.  However, billions of Chinese children know it works.  The problem?  You are probably not a Chinese child.  I don't mean that you don't possess the innate ability to learn such quantity of characters.  Neither do I mean that you lack the neuroplasticity.  It's quite a bit simpler than that.  Truth is, you are not a child and likely have many other responsibilities vying for your precious time.  Even worse, you're probably more aware than ever that your time is limited, so you are even less likely to want to waste it.

The solution?  Learn characters like an adult.  Utilize your wealth of life experience and highly tuned wetware to hack memorization.  Throw out everything that's not essential for learning the meaning of characters.  You know, less useful things like *how to pronounce them*.  Instead, learn their meanings in *English*.

How? *{{ page.title }}* will teach you how to create outlandish stories about characters that are surprisingly hard to forget.  While ultimately consistent and true to the modern meaning of each character, at times the book's approach will clearly stray from the academic meaning of a few of the radicals (part of a Chinese character).  Much to the chagrin of conventional Chinese language pedagogy, it's through this method that the authors manage to teach 3,000 characters to their *first year* college students.  Effectively mastering the hardest part of the Chinese language upfront.  Learning the rest is comparatively easy and literacy will go a long way to helping you keep your Mandarin for a lifetime.
