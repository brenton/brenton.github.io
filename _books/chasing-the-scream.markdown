I'm writing these notes in 2020 based on my memory from reading it around a year ago.  This book is highly relevant in a moment where we're thinking hard about the tactics law enforcement should use to protect us.  It's even more relevant when you consider the case the author makes for the racist underpinnings of the more than 100 year history of the War on Drugs.  Add in a recession and I believe there is hope that even the most staunch drug war apologist might rethink some of their beliefs after wrestling with the evidence expounded over the 400 or so pages.

This book probably deserves a bit of a disclaimer.  It is one of the handful that I have read that made me feel physically sick.  So much so that even reading the name Joe Arpaio [in the NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/us/politics/arizona-election-joe-arpaio.html?campaign_id=9&emc=edit_nn_20200804&instance_id=20953&nl=the-morning&regi_id=101143335&segment_id=35161&te=1) three days ago engendered a gut-churning reflex.  It was as if my stomach recognized him before my mind.  Moments later, I remembered [exactly why I knew the name](https://chasingthescream.com/2014/12/11/8-state-of-shame/).

It's for exactly that category of journalism that I'm rating this book a {{ page.rating }} out of 10.  {{ page.author }} risked his life to bring us this poignant writing on the braided economics of gangs, cartels and law enforcement all the while weaving together an overarching narrative of addiction and more importantly, _hope_.
