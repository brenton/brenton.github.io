takeaway: Our problem is not racism, it's castism.  Our system is every bit as severe as the other well known castes in our world.

_We find our protagonist taking a leisurely bike ride during his day off in Barely Urban Southern City.  It's been a long year working from home and he can't believe it's been months since he's been on this side of town.  He can't help but reminisce about how lively this place used to be.  In the distance he sees a lone black man walking to his car in a nearby parking lot._

_Dominant Caste Protagonist (DCP)_: (_Sound of squeaking brakes_) Whoah, hey man!  How have you been? (_Slips on face mask_)

_Hapless Brown Friend (HBF)_: Happy 2021 to you old friend!  Wow, I haven't seen you in since the pandemic started.  I've been better but I can't complain.  You know my restaurant shut down a month ago.  I miss the random thoughts you used to share whenever you stopped by for lunch.  Have you read anything good lately?

_DCP_: You know there's always something.  I've read about a dozen books on philosophy, morality, economics and medicine since this whole mess started this year.  I'm sure I can drum up a good rant for you if you have the time!

_HBF_: Ha, I wish I did. Unfortunately, I'm a little pressed for time.  Just tell me the title and I'll trust it's good enough to pick up at the library.  I need to make some more deliveries for Whole Foods and then I'm going to drive for Lyft most of the night.  I don't have paid time off during the holidays like you.

_DCP_: Oh, I'm sorry.  I mean, it's great to have a job.  But have you ever done the math to make sure that you're actually making money?  Even the IRS estimates the cost for driving a business car is 58 cents per mile.  That would make it mathematically impossible in our city to come out ahead given how spread out things are.  Plus, I remember you saying you have a car payment.

_HBF_: I think about it, but this is what I have right now.  I don't plan to do this long term.  At least this way I can continue working for myself and setting my own hours.  That means more to me than money.

_DCP_: That's a good point.  Still, you really should sell that luxury land yacht and get a used bike like mine.  Do you realize how much money I saved in 2020 driving less than three hundred miles and biking a few thousand?

_HBF_: That's really cool.  But it wouldn't be that easy for me.

_DCP_: You'd get used to it.  Even my kids biked hundreds of miles this year.  Of course, you couldn't drive for Lyft or deliver for Whole Foods.  I looked into Whole Food delivery myself since I thought it might be fun over the holidays.  They only allow bike deliveries in actual cities like New York.  So, yeah, it wouldn't be easy—but you'd find something even better!

_HBF_: No, you don't quite understand.

_DCP_: Sure I do.  I've been riding for nearly a decade in this town.  Whatever you need I can help you with.  If you wanted you could just borrow one of my bikes if you're worried about finding something.  I'll admit, prices really have gone up this year.  Just say the word and I'll do anything to help get you out of that metal box you ride around in.

_HBF_: OK.  Can you make me white? 

_DCP_: What are talking about?

_HBF_: It's not safe for me.  You're white.  You work at a software company.  It's OK for you to show up to work on a rusty bike.  I'm being serious.  I have to dress nicer to go to the gas station than you do for work.  My own neighbors would call the cops on me if I rode home after dark dressed the way you are _right now_.  They'd claim I was trying to steal their Amazon packages or dealing drugs.

_DCP_: Yikes.  I'm such a jerk.  I mean, I know these things in my head—and you know I read on this this!—but I still struggle to make even simple connections in real time.  What I mean is, it's easier for me to reflect on the injustice of "big problems" like the industry I work in.  Hundreds of people contribute to the product I work on.  There is one black person on the team.  One.  Everyone I work with knows this is screwed up and hates it.  Still, I'm ignorant to see how something as simple as riding my bike is [steeped in white privilege](https://surlybikes.com/blog/realities_of_a_black_man_in_the_bike_world).  Man... I hope I didn't ruin your day.

_HBF_: Not at all _Brenton_.  Have a great ride!  I'll see you around in 2021.

_On the best of days I can be naive but sincere.  On others I can be a glib jerk._
