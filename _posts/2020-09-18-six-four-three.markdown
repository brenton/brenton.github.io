No—I assure you—  
There’s only one way.  
And as life,  
It starts with cry.  
As death,  
It will end in tears.

It's also not fair:  
That a boy's game should be harder than a man's,  
That earth and time should conspire on such a small field  
With one on and less than two down.

Three and a half seconds would be grace in Greenville.  
Though every fielder, a pitcher,  
The baserunners have wheels. 

So forget not the rituals.  
Nothing more is in your control,  
And nothing less will do.  
Dugout don your rally caps,  
Fielders raise two fingers and cry,  
"Turn two!"

The arms race now gives way to legs.  
Don’t stand there and wait.  
No, you must tear forward,  
Lunge when the leather rocket choses you.

It’s not merely that time is short—for it most certainly is—  
More important is to tame it’s stride,  
To snatch that darting rabbit from the air.

Think,  
Keep your hands low,  
With luck,  
You’ll at least knock it down.  
And if hope for two is spoiled,  
You may still get one in the end.

Forget I said that.  
Never settle for one though two be forlorn.  
Should you make it this far,  
Lay out—if you must—when it tells you.

Now resurrect the lifeless mass in your hand.  
Let your cannon thunder,  
Let not the rope thaw.

*Pray your friends are fast  
Whatever the score—  
And when you fail  
That you try once more.*
