Restless nights:  
My heart’s rent.  
(Both ways you read that are true.)

Since you asked what I’m talking about,  
Yes, I did think it was a good idea at the time.  
I needed the money and she needed someone who’d love her.

What I wouldn’t do to have a shot at that punk kid with the yellow hair.  
There are things money can’t afford   
And learning that sooner would have done me good.  
If you don’t hate me yet,  
Does it help I enjoyed burning that bridge?  
I set it ablaze as good as any you've seen.  
Betraying the one who held my hand  
When no one else would.

It seems just that twenty-two years later  
I should long for the other side of that ravine—  
To have one foot on Sinai and the other in Egypt.  
What could have become of our lifetime together?  
Should ashes be the memory of our two year flame?  
Oh, to fan it anew!  
To see the phoenix reborn  
And restore the years the locust has eaten.

This is nonsense.  
Let’s say I find her.  What good would it do?  
If I thrust myself headlong to harm’s way  
Would she save me one more time—  
Even if for old times' sake?  
No, Lazarus won't be coming back.  
I’m too old to compete with whoever she’s with now, anyway.  
Just Imagine me playing that game again—it would be torture.  
Time has arrested me and I have nothing to post bail.  
The money was spent long ago—on what—I don’t remember.  
Listen to me.

In the halls of Rose High  
I sold  
My baseball glove.
